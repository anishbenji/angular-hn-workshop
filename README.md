# AngularHn

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6. It is the repository of code used in my Angular Workshops given in May 2017. It is based on the excellent [Angular 2 Hackernews](https://houssein.me/angular2-hacker-news) tutorial by Houssein Djirdeh. The GitHub Repo for his code is [here](https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/angular2-hn).

## Using this code

Once you download this repo, open the folder in the command line. You can go to each step of the workshop directly by `git checkout step-#` where `#` is a step number between 1 and 24.

You need to have Node 6.9.0 or later and the Angular CLI installed globally to use this code.

To install all the required dependencies run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project folder.

More information provided by the Angular CLI below.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
